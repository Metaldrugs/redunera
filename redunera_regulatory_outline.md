# Redunera Regulatory Development Outline  
**Therapeutic Class:** Logic-Enhanced Renal Therapeutic  
**Indication:** CKD in patients with Type 2 Diabetes and/or Hypertension  

---

## 1. Classification Strategy  
- **Product Type:** Combination Drug (Small Molecule + Nanocarrier + Immune Modulator)  
- **Regulatory Pathway:** 505(b)(2) NDA pathway (leveraging known components with novel formulation logic)  
- **Designated Status Pursued:**
  - Fast Track (based on unmet renal need)
  - Breakthrough Therapy (pending Phase 2 outcomes)
  - Orphan Drug (for eGFR <30 segment, if distinct trial planned)

---

## 2. Preclinical Data Required  
- **Toxicology (GLP):**  
  - Multi-dose renal toxicity (rodent and large animal)  
  - Systemic histopathology on ROS-triggered release polymer  
- **PK/PD Modeling:**  
  - Simulation-validated tissue exposure using renal tracer analog  
- **Nanoparticle Carrier Safety:**  
  - Immunogenicity and clearance pathway mapping

## 3. Clinical Trial Roadmap  
**Phase 1 (safety/tolerability)**  
- N = 40 healthy volunteers  
- Focus on entropy stabilizer and ROS-triggered release pharmacokinetics  

**Phase 2a (signal and dose finding)**  
- N = 60 CKD patients (eGFR 30–60)  
- Endpoints: eGFR stabilization, proteinuria, CRP, TNFα  

**Phase 2b (adaptive logic optimization)**  
- Logic refinement using SEI-guided entropy/immune scoring to stratify patients  
- Targeting model validation  

**Phase 3 (pivotal efficacy)**  
- N = 600 global, stratified by CKD+T2D vs CKD+HTN  
- Primary: eGFR slope over 12 months  
- Secondary: hospitalization rate, ACR, mortality signal

## 4. CMC and Manufacturing Considerations  
- Scalable nanoparticle-polymer manufacturing using FDA-compliant facilities  
- Entropy-stabilizer compound sourcing via existing monograph agents  
- IP-protected assembly logic for logic-layer co-encapsulation  

---

## 5. Post-Market Strategy  
- Phase IV real-world data collection on entropy scores vs response  
- Logic override audit system for black-box SEI validation tracing  
- Comparative studies with standard CKD interventions
